# Set default behavior for all files to let Git handle line endings automatically.
# This is a safe default for most text-based files.
* text=auto

# --- CRITICAL FOR CLOUD DEPLOYMENT ---
# Enforce Unix-style (LF) line endings for all shell scripts. This is mandatory
# to ensure they are executable on the Linux-based GCE virtual machine and
# prevents the '^M' execution error.
*.sh text eol=lf

# --- Binary File Handling ---
# Explicitly mark common binary file types to prevent Git from attempting
# to normalize their line endings, which can cause corruption.
